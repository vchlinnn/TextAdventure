Some game planning:

Greet the user of the program
Set up the initial state of the game, in particular, put the player in the initial room.
Print the entry text for that initial room.
While the game has not yet ended:
Get a command from the user.
Process that command along with the current room and player state and print out the results of that command.

Program Design:

Room abstract class 

Initial state: wake up in a dream. Lying on a bed in an old fashioned room. Can "wake up" anytime 
to stop. 

Goal day 1: Know who you are and what this game is about. 
Answer: you are a villager. Find the wolf. 

Goal day 2: Talk to at least 3 people.
